Task:

Write a Python program that calculates the volume of a cylinder and prints a formatted output to the console.

Requirements:

Calculate the volume of a cylinder

A cylinder is a shape that has a circle as its base, and a length. The formula for volume is as follows:

volume = area of base * length

The area of a circle is PI * r * r, where r is the radius.

Use a constant for the value of PI, set it to 3.1416

Input the radius of the base and the length

Output the volume formatted to 2 decimals

Hint - to format an floating point variable to 2 decimals, you can use this sort of print statement:


'''

def main():
    pass  #replace this line with your code for this week.  Do not remove the def main(): statement or the lines below.  The unit tests need this to work.
    #your code should start here
    
    
    #your code should end here


# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
