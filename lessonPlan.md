Certainly! Let's create a **Primm-style lesson** on **Introduction to Variables** with a focus on getting familiar with Python. We'll cover the basics of variables, how to declare them, and some best practices. Each step will include Python code examples.

## Lesson: Introduction to Variables in Python

### Step 1: What are Variables?
- **Definition**: Variables are essential for holding onto and referencing values throughout our Python programs.
- **Analogy**: Think of variables as labeled boxes where the label represents the variable name, and the content inside the box is the value that the variable holds.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    # Creating variables
    country = "United States"
    year_founded = 1776
    ```

### Step 2: Assigning Values to Variables
- **Syntax**: Use the equal sign (`=`) as an assignment operator to assign a value to a variable.
- **Note**:
    - Variables in Python are **case-sensitive**.
    - Variable names with multiple words should be separated by underscores (snake_case).
- **Example**:
    ```python
    # Assigning values to variables
    user_age = 20
    website = 'https://freecodecamp.org'
    ```

### Step 3: Naming Conventions
- **Rules**:
    - Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
    - They can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - No spaces or special characters allowed.
- **Best Practices**:
    - Choose descriptive variable names.
    - Use lowercase letters and underscores for multi-word variable names.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    # Good variable names
    site_name = "FreeCodeCamp"
    ```

### Step 4: Data Types for Python Variables
- Python is flexible with data types.
- Variables can hold various types:
    - Integers (`int`)
    - Floats (`float`)
    - Strings (`str`)
    - Booleans (`bool`)
    - Tuples (`tuple`)
    - Lists (`list`)
- **Example**:
    ```python
    # Variables with different data types
    age = 25
    price = 19.99
    name = "Alice"
    is_student = True
    favorite_colors = ["blue", "green", "red"]
    ```

### Step 5: Local vs. Global Variables
- **Local Variables**: Defined within a specific function or block of code.
- **Global Variables**: Defined outside any function and accessible throughout the program.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    def greet():
        message = "Hello, world!"  # Local variable
        print(message)

    greet()
    ```
